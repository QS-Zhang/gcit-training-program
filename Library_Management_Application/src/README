1. I fully implemented all methods that are required(100%)

2. Librarian and Borrower works perfect(100%)

3. Administrator: I have all methods implemented but I haven't added option 2-5 into the 
Administrator Logic Flow.(Quite similar and simple). I added Option1(add/update/delete book) and
 Option6( Override Due date)



Overall I would say I did 95%.

Issues:

1. Once Deleting something, the index will be wrong in the sql when inserting a new element But I know how to fix it,
just need some time.

TO RUN THE APPLICATION JUST SIMPLY RUN MainApp.java
